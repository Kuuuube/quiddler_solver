Options:
  -h,  --help                       Prints this help message.
       --skip_solving               Uses an existing quiddler_games file to generate scores from.
                                      Useful if you stop solving midway through and want to calculate scores for a partial set of games.
       --skip_sorting               Reads back scores and outputs scored games buffered line by line.
                                      Useful for avoiding memory spikes from reading all games into memory.
       --no_moving                  Prevents uncovering hidden cards when empty spaces are present.
                                      Disallowing moving can drastically cut down on the number of possible games and speed up calculation.
